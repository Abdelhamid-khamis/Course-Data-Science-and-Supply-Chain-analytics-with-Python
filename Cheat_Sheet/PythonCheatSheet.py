    Characteristics and Actions in English Grammar
Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. 
{A characteristic would be a noun}. On the other hand, {an action would be a verb}.

Let's pick something from the real-world: {a dog.}
A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. 
What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.

"""
=== Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary ====
    - class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
    - object - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something 
        in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. 
        However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.
    - attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, 
        size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, 
        large, etc.
    - method - an action that a class or object could take
    - OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming
    - encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is 
        called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. 
        In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. 
        Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like 
        how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

And then Python changes the price of the shirt_one object. When you 
call the change_price method, shirt_one.change_price(12), self is implicitly passed in.

''' == {16} Anaconda == '''
# conda: manage dependencies and isolate projects with support other languages than Python.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
"""
- Anaconda is an open source distribution for Python designed for large-scale data. 
    With Anaconda you will be able to simplify package management.
- It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda 
    to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions 
    of Python and/or different packages.

- You can install multiple packages at the same time. Something like 
conda install numpy scipy pandas
conda create -n my_env python=3.6 numpy pandas

- Conda also automatically {installs dependencies }for you. For example.
    {scipy depends on numpy}, it uses and requires numpy. If you install just scipy 
    {conda install scipy}, Conda will also install numpy if it isn't already installed.

- If you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can 
    try searching with 

conda search *search_term*         # conda search '*beautifulsoup*' هيرجعلك اسم الباكدج الصح
    e.g., I know I want to install Beautiful Soup, but I'm not sure of the exact package name.

### Managing environments
--------------------------
For example, {to create an environment named my_env and install numpy in it}, type 
conda create -n my_env numpy    # create my_env environment and install numpy in it
conda activate          # activate conda environment
conda deactivate        # deactivate conda environment


### Why we're using Python 3
-----------------------------
    - Jupyter is switching to Python 3 only
    - Python 2.7 is being retired
    - Python 3 has been out for almost 10 years, and there are very few dependencies.


### The main breakage between Python 2 and 3?
----------------------------------------------
    The place where your Python 2 code will fail most often is {the print statement}.

# Python 2
    print "Hello", "world!"

# In Python 2.6+
    from __future__ import print_function
    print("Hello", "world!")
    > Hello world!

# This was changed in Python 3 to a function.
    print("Hello", "world!")
    > Hello world!


### Why using conda?
--------------------

    -First, since Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages, you'll be 
        all set to start working with data. Secondly, using conda to manage your 
        packages and environments will reduce future issues dealing with the various 
        libraries you'll be using.

    - Package managers are used to install libraries and other software on your computer. 
        You’re probably already familiar with pip, it’s the default package manager 
        for Python libraries. Conda is similar to pip except that the available 
        packages are focused around data science while pip is for general use.
    
    - {conda} is not Python specific like {pip} is, it can also install non-Python packages.
        It is a package manager for any software stack.

"""























 
''' == {17} Jupyter notebooks == '''
# -------------------------------------------------------------
"""
The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, 
code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. 

Notebooks have quickly become an essential tool when working with data. You'll find them being 
    used for data cleaning and exploration, visualization, machine learning, 
    and big data analysis.


=== Headers ===
----------------
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3


=== Links ===
----------------
Linking in Markdown is done by enclosing text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses, 
like this for a link to Udacity's home page.

[Udacity's home page](https://www.udacity.com) 
[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")


=== Emphasis ===
----------------

- You can add emphasis through bold or italics with asterisks or underscores (* or _).
    For italics, wrap the text in one asterisk or underscore, {_gelato_ or *gelato*} 
    renders as gelato(italic).

- Bold text uses {two} symbols, {**aardvark** or __aardvark__} 
    looks like aardvark(bold).

- Either asterisks or underscores are fine as long as you use the same symbol on both sides of the text.




=== Code ===
----------------
There are two different ways to display code, inline with text and as a code block separated 
from the text. To format inline code, 
(1) wrap the text in backticks. 
    For example, `string.punctuation`   الزرار اللى تحت الescape
                    renders as string.punctuation.

    To create a code block, start a new line and wrap the text in three backticks

```python
import requests
response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')
```



(2) or {indent each line of the code block with four spaces}.

    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')







=== Math expressions ===
----------------

You can create math expressions in Markdown cells using LaTeX symbols. 
Notebooks use MathJax to render the LaTeX symbols as math symbols. 
To start math mode, wrap the LaTeX in dollar signs $y = mx + b$ for inline math. 
For a math block, use double dollar signs,

$$
y = \frac{a}{b+c}
$$
    renders as (y=a/b+c)









=== Lists ===
----------------

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item

⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses







=== Images ===
---------------
Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")






===Line Breaks===
------------------
My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- 
{hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline)}, then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), 
see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.





=== Horizontal Rule ===
-----------------------
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores








=== Code and Syntax Highlighting ===
-------------------------------------
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```






=== Tables ===
---------------

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3






=== YouTube Videos ===
-------------

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>








=== Magic keywords ===
------------------------
Magic keywords are special commands you can run in cells that let you 
control the notebook itself or perform system calls such as changing directories. 
For example, you can set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook with %matplotlib.

Magic commands are preceded with one or two percent signs (% or %%)


== Timing code==
At some point, you'll probably spend some effort optimizing code to run faster. 
Timing how quickly your code runs is essential for this optimization. 
You can use the timeit magic command to time how long it takes for a function to run.


%timeit function call()
%%timeit            put it at the first line of code to print the code execution time

Using a main block
To avoid running executable statements in a script when it's imported as a module in another script, 
include these lines in an if __name__ == "__main__" block. Or alternatively, 
include them in a function called main() and call this in the if main block.

Whenever we run a script like this, Python actually sets a special built-in variable called __name__ 
for any module. When we run a script, Python recognizes this module as the main program, 
and sets the __name__ variable for this module to the string "__main__". 
For any modules that are imported in this script, 
this built-in __name__ variable is just set to the name of that module.
Therefore, the condition if __name__ == "__main__"is just checking whether this module is the main program.

Data Analysis Process Overview:
--------------------------------
    it's not a linear relation but here are some steps
    1- Ask Questions:
        two types: 
            1- you're given data and need to answer questions based on it
            2- you're the one who ask questions first and gather data based on that later

        but in both cases, [great questions help you focus on relevant parts of your data 
        and direct your analysis towards meaningful insights]

    2- Wrangle data:
    تجميع وتقييم وتنضيف الداتا
        you get the data you need to work in three steps:
            2.1 gather the data you need to answer your questions
            2.2 assess your data to identify any problems in your data's quality or structure 
            2.3 clean your data by modifying, replacing or removing data to ensure that your dataset is
                of the highest quality and as well-structured as possible


    3- Explore data:

        perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis):
            finding patterns of your data, visualizing relationships in your data, and building intuition about 
            what you're working with, removing outliers and creating better features from your data(feature engineering)


    4- Draw Conclusions:
        this step is typically approached with machine learning or inferential statistics
        but data analysis focus on drawing conclusions with descriptive statistics

    5- Communicate your results:
        whether your goal is to build system( recommendation system )or sharing some valuable insights
        you just need to share what you've built, explain how you reached design decisions and report how well 
        it performs.
        There are many ways to communicate your results:
            Reports, slide decks(powerpoint presentations), blog posts, emails, presentations or even conversations.

    The NumPy arrays takes significantly less amount of memory as compared to python lists. 
    It also provides a mechanism of specifying the data types of the contents, 
    which allows further optimization of the code.

2- One such feature is speed. When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can 
    often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. 




- At the core of NumPy is the ndarray, where nd stands for n-dimensional. 
    An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. 
    In other words, an ndarray is a grid that can take on many shapes and can 
    hold either numbers or strings. In many Machine Learning problems you will 
    often find yourself using ndarrays in many different ways. 
    For instance, you might use an ndarray to hold the pixel values of an image 
    will be fed into a Neural Network for image classification.

"""
import numpy as np

"""
There are several ways to create ndarrays in NumPy. 
In the following lessons we will see two ways to create ndarrays:

    1- Using regular Python lists       np.array() 
    2-Using built-in NumPy functions
"""
# We import NumPy into Python
import numpy as np

# We create a 1D ndarray that contains only integers
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])       

# Let's print the ndarray we just created using the print() command
print('x = ', x)            # x = [1 2 3 4 5]



"""
Let's pause for a second to introduce some useful terminology. We refer to 1D arrays as rank 1 arrays. 
    In general N-Dimensional arrays have rank N. Therefore, we refer to a 2D array as a rank 2 array. 
    Another important property of arrays is their shape. The shape of an array is the size along each of its dimensions. 
    For example, the shape of a rank 2 array will correspond to the number of rows and columns of the array. 
    As you will see, NumPy ndarrays have attributes that allow us to get information about them 
    in a very intuitive way. 
    For example, the shape of an ndarray can be obtained using the .shape attribute. 
    The shape attribute returns a tuple of N positive integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. 
    In the example below we will create a rank 1 array and learn how to obtain its shape, 
    its type, and the data-type (dtype) of its elements.
"""

# We create a 1D ndarray that contains only integers
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# We print x
print()
print('x = ', x)
print()

# We print information about x
print('x has dimensions:', x.shape)     # (5,)
print('x is an object of type:', type(x))   # type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
print('The elements in x are of type:', x.dtype)    #  type: int32





# We create a rank 1 ndarray from a Python list that contains integers and strings
x = np.array([1, 2, 'World'])

# We print the ndarray

print('x = ', x)

# We print information about x
print('x has dimensions:', x.shape)
print('x is an object of type:', type(x))
print('The elements in x are of type:', x.dtype)


"""
We can see that even though the Python list had mixed data types, the elements in x are all of the same type, 
namely, Unicode strings of 21 characters. We won't be using 
ndarrays with strings for the remaining of this introduction to NumPy, 
but it's important to remember that ndarrays can hold strings as well.

b[0:1, :]
c[1,...]
a[ : :-1]               # Reversed array a 


# Boolean Indexing
a[a<2]                  # Select elements from a less than 2

#  Fancy Indexing
b[[1, 0, 1, 0],[0, 1, 2, 0]]        # Select elements (1,0),(0,1),(1,2) and (0,0)

b.reshape(3,-2)                     # Reshape, but don’t change data
# Adding/Removing Elements
h.resize((2,6))                     # Return a new array with shape (2,6)

np.insert(a, 1, 5)                  # Insert items in an array

How to Search - Here are some techniques for effective web searching:

1- Try using "Python" or the name of the library you're using as the first word of your query. 
2- This tells the search engine to prioritize results that are explicitly related to the tools you're using.
3- Writing a good search query can take multiple attempts. 
4- If you don't find helpful results on your first attempt, try again.
5- Try using keywords found on the pages you found in your initial search to direct the 
    search engine to better resources in the subsequent search.
6- Copy and paste error messages to use as search terms. This will lead you to explanations 
    of the error and potential causes. An error message might include references 
    to specific line numbers of code that you wrote. Only include the part of the error 
    message that comes before this in your search.
7- If you can't find an answer to your question, ask it yourself! Communities like 
    StackOverflow have etiquette rules you must learn if you want to participate, 
    but don't let this stop you from using these resources.

e.g. UnboundLocalError: local variable 'egg_count' referenced before assignment
        my search query should be: python UnboundLocalError: local variable

        official documentation surveys Python's syntax and standard library. 
        It uses examples, and is written using less technical language than the main 
        documentation. Make sure you're reading the Python 3 version of the docs!

    2- https://docs.python.org/3/index.html - The Python Language and Library References - 
        The Language Reference and Library Reference are more technical than the tutorial, 
        but they are the definitive sources of truth. As you become increasingly

=== Version Control ===

using branches, commit messages and merging

git: version control system

* you are working on a feature for a company recommendation system, recommend content
    based on some demographic data, and the BI Team recommends you to recommend based on
    the friends group suggestions, and you chose to do both features.

== The journey == 

Company has a git repository for its recommendation engine,
    and has a master & develop branch.
    * master branch(holds the code used in production)
    * version branch (holds the stable version of code with changes
                        for the next release)
    


You have a local version of this git repo on your local machine.
    pull from the develop branch to get the latest stable version>

    * to work on the demographic feature, you have to create a new branch
        called demographic(git commit changes)
    * to work on the friend group feature, you have to switch to develop branch
        and create a new friends group branch(git commit changes)
    * Merge friend group feature with the develop branch
    * push this to the remote company's repository's develop branch
    ** After the developed code is reviewed fromthe team, it's pushed to the 
        master branch


STEP 1: You have a local version of this repository on your laptop, and to get the latest stable version, you pull from the develop branch.
Switch to the develop branch

git checkout develop [repo URL]

Pull latest changes in the develop branch

git pull [Repo URL]




STEP 2: When you start working on this demographic feature, you create a new branch for this called demographic, and start working on your code in this branch.
Create and switch to new branch called demographic from develop branch

git checkout -b demographic

Work on this new feature and commit as you go

git commit -m 'added gender recommendations'
git commit -m 'added location specific recommendations'
...




STEP 3: However, in the middle of your work, you need to work on another feature. So you commit your changes on this demographic branch, and switch back to the develop branch.
Commit changes before switching

git commit -m 'refactored demographic gender and location recommendations '


Switch to the develop branch

git checkout develop




STEP 4: From this stable develop branch, you create another branch for a new feature called friend_groups.
Create and switch to new branch called friend_groups from develop branch

git checkout -b friend_groups



STEP 5: After you finish your work on the friend_groups branch, you commit your changes, switch back to the development branch, merge it back to the develop branch, and push this to the remote repository’s develop branch.
* Commit changes before switching

git commit -m 'finalized friend_groups recommendations '

* Switch to the develop branch

git checkout develop

* Merge friend_groups branch to develop

git merge --no-ff friends_groups

* Push to remote repository
git push origin develop




STEP 6: Now, you can switch back to the demographic branch to continue your progress on that feature.
* Switch to the demographic branch
git checkout demographic
